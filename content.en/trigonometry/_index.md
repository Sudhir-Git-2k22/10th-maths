### atmost six. Viete introduced the term “coefficient” in mathematics. 
### He provided a simple formula relating the roots of a equation with its coefficients. He 
### also provided geometric methods to solve doubling the cube and trisecting the angle

### Learning Outcomes

### To recall trigonometric ratios.

### To recall fundamental relations between the

### trigonometric ratios of an angle.

### To recall trigonometric ratios of complementary angles.

### To understand trigonometric identities.

### To know methods of solving problems concerning heights and distances

### of various objects.

## 6.1 Introduction

### From very ancient times surveyors, navigators and astronomers have made use of triangles to determine distances that could not be measured directly. This gave birth to the branch of mathematics what we call today as “Trigonometry”.

### Hipparchus of Rhodes around 200 BC(BCE), constructed a table of chord lengths for a circle of circumference 360 x 60 = 21600 units which corresponds to one unit of circumference for each minute of arc. For this achievement, Hipparchus is considered as

### “The Father of Trigonometry” since it became the basis for further development.

### Indian scholars of the 5th century AD(CE), realized that working with half-chords 

### for half-angles greatly simplified the theory of chords and its application to astronomy. 

### Mathematicians like Aryabhata, the two Bhaskaras and several others developed 

### astonishingly sophisticated techniques for calculating half-chord (Jya) values.

### Mathematician Abu Al-Wafa of Baghdad believed to have invented the tangent

### function, which he called the “Shadow”. Arabic scholars did not know how to translate

### the word Jya, into their texts and simply wrote jiba as a close approximate word.

### Misinterpreting the Arabic word ‘jiba’ for ‘cove’ or ‘bay’, translators wrote the Arabic 

### word ‘jiba’ as ‘sinus’ in Latin to represent the half-chord. From this, we have the name ‘sine’

### used to this day. The word “Trigonometry” itself was invented by German mathematician 

### Bartholomaeus Pitiscus in the beginning of 17th century AD(CE).

### Trigonometric ratios of complementary angle

```
sin( 90 °− qq )c= os cos( 90 °− qq )s= in tan( 90 °− qq )c= ot
cosec( 90 °− qq )s= ec sec( 90 °− qq )=cosec cot( 90 °− qq )t= an
```
### Visual proof of trigonometric complementary angle

### Consider a semicircle of radius 1 as shown in the figure.

### Let ∠= QOP q.

### Then ∠= QOR 90 °− q , so that OPQR forms a rectangle.

### From triangle OPQ , OP

#### OQ

```
=cos q
```
### Note

### All right triangles with q as one of the angle are

### similar. Hence the trigonometric ratios defined

### through such right angle triangles do not depend on

### the triangle chosen.


```
Trigonometry 241
```
### But OQ = radius = 1

### ∴ OPOQ ==cosc qq os

### Similarly, PQ

#### OQ

### =sinθ

### Þ PQ == OQ sins qq in ( OQ = 1)

### OP = cosθ, PQ = sinθ ... (1)

### Now, from triangle QOR ,

### we have OR

#### OQ

```
=°cos( − q )
```
### ∴ OROQ =°cos( − q )

### OR =°cos( − q )

### Similarly, RQ

#### OQ

```
=°sin( − q )
```
### Then, RQ =°sin( − q )

### OR =°cos( − q )90 , RQ =°sin( − q )90 ... (2)

### OPQR is a rectangle,

### OP = RQ and OR = PQ

### Therefore, from (1) and (2) we get,

### sin( 90 °− qq )c= os and cos( 90 °− qq )s= in

### Thinking Corner

### 1. When will the values of sin q and cos q be equal?

### 2. For what values of q , sin q = 2?

## 3. Among the six trigonometric quantities, as the value of angle increase from

### 0 °to 90 °, which of the six trigonometric quantities has undefined values?

### 4. Is it possible to have eight trigonometric ratios?

### 5. Let 09 °≤ q ≤° 0. For what values of q does

### (i) sinc qq > os (ii) coss qq > in (iii) sect qq = 2 an (iv) cosec qq =2cot

## 6.2 Trigonometric Identities

### For all real values of q , we have the following three identities.

### (i) sin=^22 qq +cos 1 (ii) 1+tan^22 qq =sec (iii) 1 +=cot^22 qq cosec

### These identities are termed as three fundamental identities of trigonometry.

### We will now prove them as follows.

### From (4), 122 +=(cot qq )(cosec )^2

### Hence, 1 +=cot^22 qq cosec

### Activity 1

### Take a white sheet of paper. Construct two perpendicular lines OX, OY which

### meet at O , as shown in the Fig. 6.4(a).

### Considering OX as X axis, OY as Y axis.

### We will verify the values of sin q and cos q for

### certain angles q.

### Let q = 30 °

### Construct a line segment OA of any length such

### that ∠= AOX 30,° as shown in the Fig. 6.4(b).

### Draw a perpendicular from A to OX , meeting at B.

### Now using scale, measure the lengths of AB, OB and OA.

### Find the ratios AB

#### OA

#### , OB

#### OA

### and AB

#### OB

### .

### What do you get? Can you compare these values with

### the trigonometric table values? What is your conclusion?

## 6.3 Heights and Distances

### In this section, we will see how trigonometry is used for

### finding the heights and distances of various objects without actually

### measuring them. For example, the height of a tower, mountain, building or tree, distance

### of a ship from a light house, width of a river, etc. can be determined by using knowledge

### of trigonometry. The process of finding Heights and Distances is the best example of

### applying trigonometry in real-life situations. We would explain these applications through

### some examples. Before studying methods to find heights

### and distances, we should understand some basic definitions.

### Line of Sight

### The line of sight is the line drawn from the eye of an

### observer to the point in the object viewed by the observer. Fig. 6.

```
Line of sight
```

```
Trigonometry 251
```
### Theodolite

### Theodolite is an instrument which is used in measuring the angle

### between an object and the eye of the observer. A theodolite consists of two

### graduated wheels placed at right angles to each other and a telescope. The

### wheels are used for the measurement of horizontal and vertical angles. The

### angle to the desired point is measured by positioning the telescope towards

### that point. The angle can be read on the telescope scale.

### Angle of Elevation

### The angle of elevation is an angle formed by

### the line of sight with the horizontal when the point

### being viewed is above the horizontal level. That is,

### the case when we raise our head to look at the object.

### (see Fig. 6.7)

### Angle of Depression

### The angle of depression is an angle formed by the line of

### sight with the horizontal when the point is below the horizontal

### level. That is, the case when we lower our head to look at the

### point being viewed. (see Fig. 6.8)

### Clinometer

### The angle of elevation and depression are usually

### measured by a device called clinometer.

### ¾ From a given point, when height of an object

### increases the angle of elevation increases.

### If hh 12 > then αβ >

### ¾ The angle of elevation increases as we

### move towards the foot of the vertical

### object like tower or building.

### If dd 21 < then βα >

### From a point on the ground, which is 20m

### away from the foot of the tower, the angle

### of elevation of the top of the tower is found

### to be 45°.

### the top of the chimney from her eyes is 45°.

### ......................................

### From a point P on the ground the angle of

### elevation of the top of a 20 m tall building

### is 30°. A flag is hoisted at the top of the

### building and the angle of elevation of the

### top of the flagstaff from P is 55°.

### ......................................

### The shadow of a tower standing on a level

### ground is found to be 40 m longer when

### the Sun’s altitude is 30° than when it is 60°.

### ........................................

### 6.3.1 Problems involving Angle of Elevation

### In this section, we try to solve problems when Angle of elevation are given.

### Example 6.

### Calculate Ð BAC in the given triangles. (tan

### 38.7° = 0.8011, tan 69.4° = 2.6604)

### Example 6.19 A tower stands vertically on the ground. From a point on the ground,

### which is 48 m away from the foot of the tower, the angle of elevation of the top of the tower

### is 30 °. Find the height of the tower.

### Solution Let PQ be the height of the tower.

### Ta k e PQ = h and QR is the distance between the tower

### and the point R. In the right angled ∆ PQR , ∠= PRQ 30 °

### tan q = PQ

#### QR

### tan3 0

#### 48

### °= h Þ 1

#### 3 48

### = h Þ h = 163

### Therefore, the height of the tower is 163 m

### Example 6.20 A kite is flying at a height of 75 m above the ground. The string attached

### to the kite is temporarily tied to a point on the ground. The inclination of the string

### with the ground is 60 °. Find the length of the string, assuming that there is no slack

### in the string.

### Solution Let AB be the height of the kite above the ground. Then, AB = 75.

### Let AC be the length of the string.

### In the right angled ∆ ABC , ∠= ACB 60 °

### sin q = AB

#### AC

### sin6 0 °=^75

#### AC

### Þ 3

#### 2

#### =^75

#### AC

### Þ AC =^150

#### 3

#### = 503

### Hence, the length of the string is 503 m.

### Example 6.21 Two ships are sailing in the sea on either sides of a lighthouse. The

### angle of elevation of the top of the lighthouse as observed from the ships are 30 ° and

### 45 °respectively. If the lighthouse is 200 m high, find the distance between the two

### ships. ( 31 =. 732 )

### Solution Let AB be the

### lighthouse. Let C and D be the

### positions of the two ships.

### Then, AB = 200 m.
