# Geometry
## Introduction

The study of Geometry is concerned with knowing properties of various shapes and 
structures. Arithmetic and Geometry were considered to be the two oldest branches of 
mathematics. Greeks held Geometry in high esteem and used its properties to discuss 
various scientific principles which otherwise would have been impossible. Eratosthenes 
used the similarity of circle to determine the circumference of the Earth, distances 
of the moon and the sun from the Earth, to a remarkable accuracy. Apart from these 
achievements, similarity is used to find width of rivers, height of trees and much more. 

In this chapter, we will be discussing the concepts mainly as continuation of previous 
classes and discuss most important concepts like Similar Triangles, Basic Proportionality 
Theorem, Angle Bisector Theorem, the most prominent and widely acclaimed Pythagoras 
Theorem and much more. Cevaâ€™s Theorem and Menelaus Theorem is introduced for the first 
time. These two new theorems generalize all concurrent theorems that we know. Overall, the 
study of Geometry will create interest in the deep understanding of objects around us. 
 
Geometry plays vital role in the field of Science, Engineering and Architecture. We 
see many Geometrical patterns in nature. We are familiar with triangles and many of their 
properties from earlier classes.
